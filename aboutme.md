Hi, thanks for being here! My name is Nayeon Kim and currently based in Singapore. 

### My story

I was born and raised in South Korea, and moved to Singapore at the age of 14. I went to a private school in Singapore and managed to be  admitted to the o-level class only after studying for two months. After intense couple of years of studying, I ended up at SIM GE majoring in computer science.
